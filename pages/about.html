                    <h3>Everything Cars</h3>
                    <p>Recently after I graduated from high school, my interest in cars and engines has grown exponentially. I love the variety in the brands, along with getting to know the pros and cons of each model. My current favorite car is the Audi RS7, however it changes all the time. The diversity in cars today is amazing, with most vehicles sharing similar features but none of them looking exactly the same. Hearing the growl of a V8 revving, or even idling, will always make me happy!</p>

                    <h3>Computers</h3>
                    <p>I have long been fascinated with computers and how they function. I received my first laptop as a gift for Christmas when I was around 10 years old, and I have been obsessed with them ever since. I currently have 3 computers that I work on and use almost daily, and I have undoubtedly spent more time with computers than anything else. I have gotten to the point where I am very comfortable navigating their interfaces and finding solutions by myself! NVIDIA > AMD</p>

                    <h3>Video Games</h3>
                    <p>Since I have a love for computers, it only makes sense that I also have a love for video games. They are a great way to escape reality and allow you to enjoy yourself, however it is hard to not overdo it. Video games can be very addicting, which is why I recommend finding a good balance between gaming and other activities. I'm a bit of a wildcard when it comes to my favorite games. Some of them include Dead by Daylight, Destiny 2, Rainbow Six Siege, RUST, and Dying Light.</p>

                    <h3>Seafood</h3>
                    <p>I was a very picky eater when I was younger, however as I have gotten older I have grown to love many types of food. Some of my most-liked foods include basically any Italian or Chinese dish, American, and Mexican. However, seafood takes the cake as my favorite. Shrimp, scallops, lobster, salmon, crab, you name it. I love it all, and I would eat it everyday if I had the budget. One of my dreams is to travel to a tropical country and try some fresh seafood, cajun if possible.</p>

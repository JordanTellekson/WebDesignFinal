                    <h2>Quick Intro</h2>
                    Hello, my name is Jordan Tellekson and I am currently attending Mid-State Technical College for IT Software Development! I am constantly looking for a challenge, and I don't give up until the task is complete. I prefer working alone because it allows me to learn hands on and commit my work to memory. However, I can get along with just about anybody and I am more than capable of working in a team setting. When it comes to the workplace, I think that reliance is one of the most important things to consider when hiring a potential candidate, as being reliable can prove your commitment to a company. I am a very reliable employee, and I am committed to making a positive difference at your workplace! Aside from prioritizing workplace reliability, I am also empathetic. In these post-COVID times, it is becoming increasingly harder to find genuine, empathetic people. I am able to relate and provide advice, which in theory should increase overall workplace efficiency and promote a generally positive environment. I am looking forward to working with you!
